# DataScience Portfolio
A collection of my own data science projects - not work related

Data driven Astronomy - python notebooks and supporting data for the data driven astronomy course on coursera.  The main course uses grok for the in course work, but I made similar notebooks as well as some supplementary ones exploring the astonomical data.
The course covers - data stacking, scalability of data algorithms
